Gatsby.js(https://www.gatsbyjs.org), awesome tool for static website.

- It simplify website into page and links.
- One of the greatest work with Gatsby is with the integration with css. CSS modules(https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) solves the problem of scoped css, which has been used in React. Styled component(https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) makes the component with styles.  
- Typography.js(https://github.com/kyleamathews/typography.js), really awesome tool for add style for the whole website. There are already 30+ themes.
- About router, Gatsby provides the solution of creating layout for all the pages, and provide links for linking pages.
- Four parts in the front-end: html, css, js, and data. It is excellent to have data inside the site but sometimes we have need to move data outside of the code. In that way, reuse of the data and chaning data will be much more convenient. 
- Data can come from APIs, databases, CMSs, local files.
